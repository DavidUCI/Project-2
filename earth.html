        <p class="fin-nd" id="nd-txt">Global warming is causing more drastic<br> 
            weather changes and patterns.<br>  Earthâ€™s rising temperatures are linked to<br> 
            heavier rainfall, more frequent droughts,<br> more powerful storms, and longer,<br> 
            hotter, and more frequent heat waves.  
        </p>

        <p class="fin-hw" id="hw-txt">The earth is now 1.1 degrees Celsius<br> 
            (33.98 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than<br> in the 1800s.  According to the<br> 
            United Nations, 2015 through<br> 2019 were the five warmest years on record,<br> 
            while 2010-2019 was the warmest decade on record.<br> 
            According to the U.S. Global Change Research<br> Program, the 1960s had an average of two heat waves<br> 
            per year in major cities across the<br> United States in comparison to more than<br> 
            six in the 2020s, and the average<br> heat wave season across fifty major<br>
             cities is forty-nine days longer<br> than it was in the 1960s.

        <p class="fin-ag" id="ag-txt">According to the United States Environmental<br> 
            Protection Agency, global warming<br> poses a threat to livestock, fisheries,<br> 
            and crops.  Crops run the risk of having<br> a reduced yield, and although the<br>
            increases in carbon dioxide and the warmer<br> climate can help some plants grow,<br> 
            the higher frequency of floods and droughts<br> heavily impact the yields we get from crops.<br>  
            Likewise, livestock are also at risk <br>directly from environmental stress, such as<br>
            extreme heat, as well as being at risk<br> from a reduced quality in their food supply.<br>  
            Global warming poses a threat to fisheries<br> due to the change in water temperature, which<br>
            can see the lifecycle timing of certain fish<br> species change entirely and can see the water<br> 
            accommodate more for invasive species.  Food<br> distribution could also be impacted by changes<br>
            in the climate, for example, harsh weather<br> conditions can impact waterways, most of which<br> 
            do not have alternative routes and are<br> commonly depended on to transport grains.
        </p>

        <p class="fin-hh" id="hh-txt">According to the United Nations,<br>
        global warming can also pose risks<br> to human health.  People suffering from<br>
        respiratory issues and heart complications<br> could be at a higher risk from changes<br> 
        in the environment.  An increase in<br> temperature forces the cardiovascular system<br> 
        to work harder to keep the body cool,<br> and thus, puts more stress on the heart,<br> 
        creating a problem for those who struggle<br> with heart and cardiovascular issues.<br>  
        Along with temperature increases come<br> increased ozone concentration which can<br> 
        damage lung tissue and cause larger<br> complications for people suffering from asthma<br> 
        and lung disease.
